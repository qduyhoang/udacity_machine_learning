1.1: A file called "core" is created

1.2: From strcmp() inside inTable() function

1.3:
c. The problem comes from the loop condition (num_lines) when looping through the array st. The array st only has MAX_LINES elements. num_lines might be > MAX_LINES, resulting in null pointer reference, causing segmentation fault
Solution: Changing the looping condition from i < num_lines to i < MAX_LINES
e. The problem happens when performing the subtraction. The order of the calculation was wrong: the lhs was the last element pop from the stack.
Solution: Switching the order: the lhs is now the first element pop from the stack.
f. The segmentation violation is caused because the function doesn't check if the integer n is larger than the size of the given array.
Solution: Adding the condition to check if n is valid.

1.4: The compiler doesn't catch semantic errors.

1.5: The function will simply not work. It doesn't raise any error because it is a semantical error.
